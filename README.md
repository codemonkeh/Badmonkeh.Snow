# Badmonkeh.Snow

This is my current blog, badmonkeh.com, built using my custom build of Sandra.Snow. The blog was converted from WordPress using `wpXml2Jekyll`, see below for more information.

### Converting WordPress export to Markdown
1. Generate the Markdown

	`wpXml2Jekyll [wordpress export file] [output folder]`

2. Separate any posts and pages 
3. Posts
	1. Move the posts into Snow's `_posts` folder
	2. Remove the enclosing square brackets "[]" from the categories in each post's header
	3. Separated categories and tags in each post's header
	4. As my code was html formatted for SyntaxHighlighter with `<pre class="brush: c#">` tags, i had to remove the pre blocks and `TAB` indent the block. I also de-encoded the code to be consistent.
	2. ...
2. Copy the SnowByte (or Default) theme
3. Customise each template 
4. As i didn't keep the default style.css from the theme i had to manually download and reference prettify.css to enable auto syntax highlighting
4. ...
4. Convert the pages content into Razor syntax, and save as .cshtml files
5. (Had to) Compile the Snow solution locally as there is a bug which does not show the error messages generated by Nancy when parsing the views/templates
6. Enhanced Snow to allow indexing by keyword/tag
